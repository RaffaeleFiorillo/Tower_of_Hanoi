# Tower_of_Hanoi
Implementation of the famous puzle "Tower of Hanoi". The setup consists of three pegs (sticks) and a certain amount of discs (in this implementation there can be a maximum of 6 discs).
The discs have different sizes, and are placed on top of each other sorted from the biggest to the smallest.
